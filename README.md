# I love Graphs-


# 27/10/2022: Added code that checks the leaf proprities of a node in a tree graph.
Nothing crazy, it does it's job based on the data imported. I will edit the data input for this later, I don't like how it is for now.


# 30/10/2022:

Uploaded a file that does the simple job of creating a list of nodes and gives the user the ability to add nodes to it. I will have to figure out how to do the same for dictionaries or classes so that I can implement some median computations.

# 12/11/2022:

Uploaded a user input setup that allows adding nodes into a dictionary.
This has to be updated later on as I did not originally want them to be added as tupples.
